    <h1>Vision ML Tools</h1>

    <p>This plugin adds several tools and filters which use Neural Networks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Segmentation Tools: Select objects by clicking on them or drawing a rectangle around them. <i>Find them among the selection tools in the tool bar.</i></li>
        <li>Inpainting Tool: Similar to Krita's "Smart Patch", uses a simple GAN to predict content to fill small gaps. <i>The tool is located next to Smart Patch on the tool bar.</li>
        <li>Background Removal: Filter which separates foreground objects from background. <i>Can be found in the top menu below Filters > Other > Background Removal...</li>
    </ul>
